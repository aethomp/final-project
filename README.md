# final-project
As an individual final project, I would like to expand my knowledge of Ruby by creating and localizing a simple application. I plan to build on the skills we will cover in class by following the Learn Ruby on Rails tutorial (http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html) to build a small app, which includes several static pages and a form with confirmation and error messages. I will subsequently internationalize the app and localize it into French.

General documentation for the tutorial app is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails
It includes information on the required Ruby and Rails versions, gems, accounts needed for app functionality, etc.

If this project is approved, I plan to begin working on the tutorial this week in conjunction with Codecademyâ€™s Ruby course. The tutorial is designed so that it can be completed in the space of a long weekend, so although I will complete it over a longer period of time, there will still be ample time for me to both create and localize the app before the end of the semester. Should anything happen to disrupt the timeline, the backup plan will be to simply internationalize and localize the app from the source already available on GitHub, rather than building it myself.

Because we have not yet delved into Ruby or Rails in class, I admittedly am not yet sure exactly how the localization process works or how demanding the project will prove to be. However, this tutorial application seems to be well attested online as a good introduction to the basics of Ruby on Rails, and I am confident that I can take on whatever challenges it may present.
